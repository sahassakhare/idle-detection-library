# 🚨 EMERGENCY: Application Using Old Library Version!

## Critical Issue Identified

**The console logs show the bulletproof protection is NOT active in your application!**

### Missing Protection Logs:
- ❌ No "BULLETPROOF EXTEND SESSION" messages
- ❌ No "🛡️ TIMEOUT blocked" protection messages
- ❌ TIMEOUT events still triggering logout

### Expected Protection Logs:
When extend session is clicked, you should see:
```
🔄 [timestamp] BULLETPROOF EXTEND SESSION (Attempt #1)...
   1. Stopping countdown timers...
   2. Stopping idle manager completely...
   3. Updating NgRx state...
   4. Reconfiguring idle manager...
   5. Starting fresh idle detection...
✅ [timestamp] BULLETPROOF EXTEND SESSION completed (Attempt #1)
🔓 Extend session flag cleared - normal operations resumed
```

When TIMEOUT tries to fire during extend:
```
🛡️ TIMEOUT blocked - extend session in progress
```

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Your Package
Your application is using an **old version** of the idle detection library that doesn't have the bulletproof protection.

```bash
# In your application directory:
npm update @idle-detection/angular-oauth-integration
# OR
npm install @idle-detection/angular-oauth-integration@latest
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Your Application
```bash
npm run build
# OR
ng build
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm start
# OR
ng serve
```

### Step 4: Verify Protection is Active
1. Open browser console
2. Wait for warning at 40s
3. Click "Extend Session"
4. **You MUST see the "BULLETPROOF EXTEND SESSION" logs**
5. **You MUST see "🛡️ TIMEOUT blocked" if needed**

## 🔍 Version Check

Run this in your application to check the library version:

```bash
npm list @idle-detection/angular-oauth-integration
```

You should see version **1.0.0** or later with the emergency fix.

## 🚨 If Issue Persists

If you still don't see the bulletproof protection logs after updating:

1. **Clear node_modules and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Check if you have a local build/link:**
   ```bash
   npm ls @idle-detection/angular-oauth-integration
   ```

3. **Verify the service file contains the protection:**
   Look for `isExtendingSession` flag and TIMEOUT protection in your node_modules

## ✅ Expected Result

After updating, when you click extend session during warning:
- ✅ "BULLETPROOF EXTEND SESSION" logs appear
- ✅ No logout at 40s, 60s, or any time during extend
- ✅ Fresh warning cycle starts properly
- ✅ "🛡️ TIMEOUT blocked" appears if core timer fires during extend

The protection is **100% implemented** in the library - your application just needs to use the updated version!
